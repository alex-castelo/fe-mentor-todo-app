## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pre-commit testing and linting
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

This is my first React project so all was new for me. I've learned several things:

- How to use `JSX` syntax
- How to use `useState` and `useEffect` hooks
- How React handles data flow

### Some code

I've really liked the what I've done here creating a hook to use local storage.

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function getStorageValue(key, defaultValue) {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem(key);
  const initial = JSON.parse(saved);
  return initial || defaultValue;
}

export const useLocalStorage = (key, defaultValue) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(() => {
    return getStorageValue(key, defaultValue);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  }, [key, value]);

  return [value, setValue];
};
```

### Continued development

"If I had continued with this project, I could have implemented various enhancements:

- Making the to-dos editable
- Enabling drag-and-drop functionality to reorder the to-do list
- Adding some end-to-end tests (E2E)
- Developing the application into a full-stack solution."
